<p>We like to acknowledge members of Be Amazing for taking the time and energy to add articles to the site. These articles offer great value to people using the site and so by sharing your expertise you make a difference!</p>

<p>The Resident Expert system is our way to give regular contributors more exposure on the site. For every category on the site we award Resident Expert status to the top three contributors within that category.</p>

<p>So how do I become a Resident Expert?</p>

<p>Here are some steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose which category you want to be a Resident Expert in (Naturoapthy, Life Coaching etc.) - It must be one of the three categories you've selected for your profile.</li>
    <li>Add articles and select which of those categories they relate too (you'll see an option to do this at the bottom of the page when you create an article)</li>
    <li>Add at least three articles under that category to qualify</li>
    <li>Keep adding more articles, the more you add, the more points you gain</li>
</ul>
